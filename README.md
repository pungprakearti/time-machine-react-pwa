This is a time machine that I created for a lightning talk I did on progressive web apps. The slides for that talk can be found here:

I'm still refactoring some things such as how the time travel year is displayed and animated. I am going to change it so it is a lot less hardcoded to allow for more dates to be entered into the time machine.

You can try out the Time Machine here:

The time machine was built in react and all graphics are created using divs and css styling. The only image I used was the github logo.

## Travel through time
Turn on the time machine and try this code: 10101.

This is a progressive web app, so try it on your phone! It works especially well on Android devices when saved to your home screen.

### BEWARE! Time travel causes a physical side effect. You've been warned.
