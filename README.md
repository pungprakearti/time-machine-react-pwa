This is a time machine that I created for a lightning talk I did on progressive web apps. The slides for that talk can be found here:

I'm still refactoring some things such as how the time travel year is displayed and animated. I am going to change it so it is a lot less hardcoded to allow for more dates to be entered into the time machine.

You can try out the Time Machine here:

The time machine was built in react and all graphics are created using divs and css styling. The only image I used was the github logo.
